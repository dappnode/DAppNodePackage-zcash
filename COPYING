The MIT software license (https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)
above applies to the code directly included in this source distribution, with
the exception of certain Autoconf macros. Dependencies downloaded as part of
the build process may be covered by other open-source licenses. The MIT-licensed
source code is not considered a derived work of these Autoconf macros or of the
dependencies. For further details see 'contrib/debian/copyright'.


Although almost all of the Zcash code is licensed under "permissive" open source
licenses, there are two dependencies that use "copyleft" open source licenses:
- Users and distributors should note that when built using the default build
  options, zcashd depends on Oracle Berkeley DB 6.2.x, which is licensed under
  the GNU Affero General Public License.
- Downstream code forks should note that zcashd depends on the 'orchard' crate,
  which is licensed under the Bootstrap Open Source License.
  A license exception is provided allowing some derived works that are linked or
  combined with the 'orchard' crate to be copied or distributed under the original
  licenses (in this case documented in 'contrib/debian/copyright'), provided that
  the included portions of the 'orchard' code remain subject to BOSL.
  See https://github.com/zcash/orchard/blob/main/COPYING for details of which
  projects can make use of this exception.
